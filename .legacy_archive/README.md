# Legacy Files Archive

This directory is for archiving old/legacy files that are no longer in active use.

## Files to Archive (if they exist in project root):
- app.py (old UI, replaced by app_refactored.py)
- finance_engine.py (old logic, functionality moved to components)

## Note:
Legacy files from previous sprints are in separate directories:
- ce-africa-valuation-Sprint16/
- ce-africa-valuation-Sprint16Final/

These can be archived separately if needed.
